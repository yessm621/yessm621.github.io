I"š<p>Abbott: Strange as it may seem, they give ball players nowadays very peculiar names.</p>

<p>Costello: Funny names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Whoâ€™s on first, Whatâ€™s on second, I Donâ€™t Know is on thirdâ€“</p>

<p>Costello: Thatâ€™s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.</p>

<p>Abbott: Iâ€™m telling you. Whoâ€™s on first, Whatâ€™s on second, I Donâ€™t Know is on thirdâ€“</p>

<p>Costello: You know the fellowsâ€™ names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, then whoâ€™s playing first?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: I mean the fellowâ€™s name on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The fellow playinâ€™ first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The guy on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, what are you askinâ€™ me for?</p>

<p>Abbott: Iâ€™m not asking youâ€“Iâ€™m telling you. Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: Iâ€™m asking youâ€“whoâ€™s on first?</p>

<p>Abbott: Thatâ€™s the manâ€™s name.</p>

<p>Costello: Thatâ€™s whoâ€™s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?</p>

<p>Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the manâ€™s entitled to it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who is?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: So who gets it?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why shouldnâ€™t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.</p>

<p>Costello: Whoâ€™s wife?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who does?</p>

<p>Abbott: Absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, all Iâ€™m trying to find out is whatâ€™s the guyâ€™s name on first base?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.</p>

<p>Costello: Iâ€™m not asking you whoâ€™s on second.</p>

<p>Abbott: Whoâ€™s on first!</p>

<p>Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: The left fielderâ€™s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: I donâ€™t know, I just thought Iâ€™d ask.</p>

<p>Abbott: Well, I just thought Iâ€™d tell you.</p>

<p>Costello: Then tell me whoâ€™s playing left field?</p>

<p>Abbott: Whoâ€™s playing first.</p>

<p>Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielderâ€™s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: Because.</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, heâ€™s center field.</p>

<p>Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?</p>

<p>Abbott: Wouldnâ€™t this be a fine team without a pitcher?</p>

<p>Costello: Tell me the pitcherâ€™s name.</p>

<p>Abbott: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ballâ€“me being a good catcherâ€“I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?</p>

<p>Abbott: Now, thatâ€™s he first thing youâ€™ve said right.</p>

<p>Costello: I DONâ€™T EVEN KNOW WHAT Iâ€™M TALKING ABOUT!</p>

<p>Abbott: Donâ€™t get excited. Take it easy.</p>

<p>Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know throws it back to tomorrowâ€“a triple play.</p>

<p>Abbott: Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p>Costello: Another guy gets up and itâ€™s a long ball to center.</p>

<p>Abbott: Because.</p>

<p>Costello: Why? I donâ€™t know. And I donâ€™t care.</p>

<p>Abbott: What was that?</p>

<p>Costello: I said, I DONâ€™T CARE!</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, thatâ€™s our shortstop!</p>
